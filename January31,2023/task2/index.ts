/*
Access Specifiers - 

Public - By default, members (properties and methods) of the TypeScript class are public - so you donâ€™t need to prefix members with the public keyword. Public members are accessible everywhere without restrictions even from the multiple level sub-classes without any compile errors.

Private - A private member cannot be accessed outside of its containing class. Private members can be accessed only within the class and even their sub-classes won't be allowed to use their private properties and attributes.

Protected - A protected member cannot be accessed outside of its containing class. Protected members can be accessed only within the class and by the instance of its sub/child class.

            The &lt;p&gt; HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.
            Paragraphs are block-level elements, and notably will automatically close if another block-level element is parsed before the closing &lt;/p&gt; tag.

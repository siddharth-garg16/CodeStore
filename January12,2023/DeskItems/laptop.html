            A <strong>laptop</strong> computer or notebook computer, also laptop or notebook for short, is a small, portable personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat panel screen (usually 11–17 in or 280–430 mm in diagonal size) on the inside of the upper lid, and an alphanumeric keyboard (typically QWERTY) on the inside of the lower lid, although 2-in-1 PCs with a detachable keyboard are often marketed as laptops or as having a "laptop mode".[1][2] The internal hardwares are fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the keyboard, and it's not uncommon for laptops to have a pointing device such as a trackpad or trackpoint. Many modern laptops also have a built-in webcam and even a touch screen display.

            Laptops run on both AC power supply and rechargeable battery pack, and can be folded shut for convenient storage and transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use.[3] Today, laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work (especially on business trips), in education, for playing games, web browsing, for personal multimedia, and for general home computer use.

            he names laptop and notebook reference the fact that the computer can be practically placed on (top of) the user's lap, and can be used similarly to a notebook. As of 2022, in American English, the terms laptop computer and notebook computer are used interchangeably;[4] in other dialects of English, one or the other may be preferred. Although the terms notebook computers or notebooks originally referred to a specific size of laptop (originally smaller and lighter than mainstream laptops of the time),[5] the terms have come to mean the same thing and notebook no longer refers to any specific size.
